In this code, the program attempts to open a file named "read.txt" for reading ("r") and a file named "write.txt" for writing ("w+"). 
It then checks if the source file (fin) exists. 
If it does, the program reads each line of the source file using getline() and writes it to the destination file (fout) using fprintf().
Finally, the program closes both files and returns 0.
